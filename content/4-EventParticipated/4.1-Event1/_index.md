### Key Highlights

#### Real-world perspective on the DevOps Engineer role

The DevOps sharing session helped me understand that DevOps is not simply about writing CI/CD pipelines, deploying Docker or Kubernetes, or fixing production issues at midnight. In reality, DevOps is closely related to systems, processes, automation, operations, and supporting development teams to work more efficiently.

Key points included:

- DevOps is not only a collection of tools such as CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud, or monitoring.
- DevOps work requires understanding how applications are built, tested, deployed, logged, and configured across different environments.
- Fundamental knowledge such as Linux, networking, Git, CI/CD, Python or Golang, and containers is very important.
- DevOps engineers need to ask “why” before asking “how”.
- Communication is an important part of the job because DevOps often requires collaboration with different teams.
- A good DevOps engineer does not only know how to use tools, but also understands systems, automates repetitive work, and makes things clearer for the team.

#### Designing a URL Shortening Service on AWS

The presentation about the URL Shortening Service helped me understand how a URL shortener can be designed on AWS with scalability in mind. Starting from a simple flow between user, frontend, backend, and database, the session expanded into a more practical architecture using services such as CloudFront, AWS WAF, Amazon Amplify, Amazon ECS, Amazon ElastiCache, and DynamoDB.

Important points included:

- A URL Shortener converts a long URL into a shorter link that is easier to share.
- The basic flow includes users submitting a URL, the frontend sending the request to the backend, and the backend generating a short code and storing it in a database.
- A simple implementation is easy to build and has low cost, but it may face issues such as security limitations, latency, single point of failure, and poor scalability.
- The frontend can use Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and Amazon Amplify to distribute content, protect the system, and simplify deployment.
- A Key Generation Service can pre-generate short codes and store them in Redis through Amazon ElastiCache to reduce load during high traffic.
- The Backend Service can use Amazon ECS, Spring Boot, Redis cache, and DynamoDB to handle link creation and redirection.
- The architecture can apply the cache-aside pattern to improve read performance and reduce direct database queries.

#### Journey from First Cloud AI Journey to AWS Partner

The sharing session by Danh Hoàng Hiếu Nghị gave me a clearer view of how students can join the AWS community and develop their career path in the cloud field. The session showed that getting the first job is only the beginning. After that, each person still needs to keep learning, gaining experience, and shaping their own direction.

Key highlights included:

- First Cloud AI Journey is a program that helps students approach cloud and AI in a more structured way.
- After starting a career, each person can grow in different directions such as Solutions Architect, DevOps Engineer, Platform Engineer, or Software Engineer.
- AWS Student Builder Group is an environment where students can learn, connect, and grow with the AWS community.
- AWS Community Builder Program helps technology enthusiasts share knowledge and contribute to the community.
- AWS Partner creates opportunities to work more deeply with the AWS ecosystem and businesses using cloud.
- Networking, continuous learning, and building a personal brand on LinkedIn are also important parts of career development.

#### The real work of a Data Analytics Engineer

The Data Analytics Engineer session helped me understand that data analytics work is not only about creating reports or dashboards. Depending on the domain, business model, and supported department, a Data Analytics Engineer can be involved in many different real-world problems.

Main points included:

- In an operations-focused business, a Data Analytics Engineer may build daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly reports to track performance.
- Dashboards help businesses monitor data trends, detect anomalies, and support decision-making.
- Data analysis is not only about presenting numbers, but also about finding root causes and proposing solutions.
- In factory or manufacturing environments, data from machines, operations, and IoT devices can be analyzed to optimize costs and improve performance.
- A Data Analytics Engineer needs to collaborate with multiple departments to solve practical business problems.

#### Skills and mindset for third-year and fourth-year students

This part emphasized that students who are preparing to enter the job market need more than technical knowledge. Skills such as critical thinking, communication, data storytelling, and problem solving are very important in a business environment.

Important ideas included:

- Critical thinking helps students analyze information objectively and make reasonable judgments.
- Communication skills help present ideas and analysis results clearly to different audiences.
- Data storytelling helps turn dry numbers into meaningful insights that can drive actions.
- Problem solving requires identifying challenges, analyzing root causes, and proposing suitable solutions.
- When preparing reports, students should not only present numbers but also understand why changes happen and what can be improved.

#### Culture in multinational corporations

The MNC culture sharing session helped me understand how multinational corporations operate, recruit, and build their working environment. Corporate culture is not just a slogan. It reflects how people in an organization think, work, and solve problems.

Key points included:

- A standard recruitment process in MNCs usually includes CV screening, initial interviews, ability tests, technical interviews, and culture-fit evaluation.
- No-Blame Post-Mortem culture in technology environments focuses on finding the root cause of incidents instead of blaming individuals.
- Caring and Inclusive culture puts people at the center, respects diversity, and encourages continuous improvement.
- Students need to prepare English ability, logical thinking, presentation skills, and the ability to work with international standards.
- To work well in a global environment, each person should learn international standards while still keeping their own identity and suitable personal mindset.

### Key Takeaways
